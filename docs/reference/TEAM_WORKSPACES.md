# Team Workspaces

A Team Workspace is a self-contained configuration bundle that lets team members get fully set up with a single command. It defines which profiles to install, which rules to apply, which projects to initialize, and any team-specific context or conventions.

Workspaces support **hierarchical inheritance** — a parent workspace defines the shared foundation, and child workspaces extend it with team-specific configuration.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# List available workspaces (shows hierarchy)
koda workspace list

# Apply a workspace (resolves inheritance automatically)
koda workspace apply opsheet-vas-team

# Configure MCP tokens
koda mcp-install
```

---

## Hierarchical Workspaces

A workspace can `extend` a parent. The child inherits the parent's profiles, rules, and context, then adds its own.

```
opsheet-team (parent)              → profiles: [dev-core, qa, ba]
  ├─ opsheet-vas-team              → inherits + [dev-web, ops, dev-vas]
  └─ opsheet-flutter-team          → inherits + [dev-mobile]
```

### Inheritance rules

| Field                                                 | Strategy                | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `profiles`                                            | Additive (union)        | parent `[dev-core, qa]` + child `[dev-web]` → `[dev-core, qa, dev-web]` |
| `rules`                                               | Additive (union)        | parent `[conventional_commit]` + child `[flutter-dev]` → both           |
| `context/`                                            | All copied (root-first) | parent's `team_context.md` + child's `vas_context.md`                   |
| `description`, `team`, `default_agent`, `jira_prefix` | Child overrides parent  | Child value wins if set                                                 |
| `projects`                                            | Child only              | Projects are team-specific                                              |

Chains can go multiple levels deep. Resolution walks bottom-up with cycle detection.

## Managing Workspaces with Koda

### Koda TUI (interactive)

Launch `koda` and press `w` to open the Workspaces screen.

| Key     | Action                                                 |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `enter` | Apply selected workspace                               |
| `e`     | Edit selected workspace                                |
| `x`     | Extend — create a child workspace from selected parent |
| `n`     | Create a new workspace from scratch                    |
| `esc`   | Back to dashboard                                      |

The TUI shows workspaces in a tree:

```
▸ opsheet-team           dev-core, qa, ba
    OpSheet+ shared foundation
  ├─ opsheet-vas-team    dev-web, ops, dev-vas
  └─ opsheet-flutter-team dev-mobile
  payments-core          dev-core, dev-web, qa, ops
```

### Koda CLI

```bash
koda workspace list                    # List with tree hierarchy
koda workspace show payments-core      # View full details
koda workspace apply opsheet-vas-team  # Apply (resolves inheritance)
koda workspace sync payments-core      # Pull all workspace repos
```

### setup.sh (for scripts and CI)

The setup script supports listing and applying workspaces. Workspace creation and editing is done through Koda.

```bash
./setup.sh workspace list                    # List with tree hierarchy
./setup.sh workspace list --fetch            # Pull latest, then list
./setup.sh workspace show payments-core      # View details
./setup.sh workspace apply opsheet-vas-team  # Apply (resolves inheritance)
./setup.sh workspace sync payments-core      # Pull all workspace repos
```

---

## Creating a Workspace

Use the Koda TUI (`koda` → `w` → `n`):

1. Fill in name, description, team, Jira prefix
2. Select profiles (space to toggle)
3. Select rules
4. Set repos path and add repositories
5. `ctrl+s` to save — Koda scaffolds the directory and publishes via PR

### Creating a child workspace

Select a parent workspace and press `x`:

1. The `extends` field is pre-filled with the parent name
2. Add only the profiles, rules, and context specific to the child team
3. The child inherits everything from the parent automatically

### Manual creation

If you prefer, create the directory structure directly:

```bash
mkdir -p workspaces/my-team/{rules,context}
# Edit workspaces/my-team/workspace.json
# Commit and push
```

---

## What Apply Does

When you run `koda workspace apply <name>`:

1. **Resolves inheritance** — walks the `extends` chain, merges profiles and rules
2. **Installs profiles** — global profiles first, then workspace-specific overrides
3. **Installs rules** — from `common/rules/` for all merged rule names
4. **Copies rules and context** — from each workspace in the chain (root-first)
5. **Injects tokens** — applies configured MCP tokens to agent configs
6. **For each project**:
   - If not cloned locally and `repo` field is set → **clones the repo** to `workspace_path/<name>`
   - If cloned but no memory bank → **initializes memory bank** from known templates or generic templates
   - If already set up → skips silently
7. **Saves active workspace** — records which workspace is active in settings

### Project path resolution

When `workspace_path` is set on a workspace (or inherited from a parent), project paths are resolved as `workspace_path + path`. This means projects only need the folder name:

```json
{
  "workspace_path": "~/Workspace/Disney/DisneyPaymentsOrg",
  "projects": [
    { "name": "wdpr-config-services", "path": "wdpr-config-services", "repo": "DisneyPaymentsOrg/wdpr-config-services" }
  ]
}
```

Koda resolves this to `~/Workspace/Disney/DisneyPaymentsOrg/wdpr-config-services`. The `repo` field enables auto-cloning when the directory doesn't exist.

---

## Syncing Repos

Pull or push all repositories in a workspace:

```bash
koda workspace sync payments-core          # fetch + pull all repos
koda workspace sync payments-core --push   # push all repos
```

---

## Best Practices

- **One parent workspace per product team** — shared foundation (profiles, rules, context)
- **Child workspaces per sub-team** — only add what's specific to that sub-team
- **Keep workspace.json in version control** — it's the team's setup contract
- **Don't put tokens in workspace files** — tokens go in `~/.kiro/tokens.env` via `koda configure`
- **Use `rules/` for team conventions** — API patterns, naming standards
- **Use `context/` for team knowledge** — deployment processes, review SLAs, team contacts
- **Test before sharing** — run `workspace apply` on a clean setup to verify

## Workspaces vs. Forks

|                        | Workspace                              | Fork                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Scope**              | Team-level config within a repo        | Full repo copy       |
| **What it customizes** | Profiles, rules, context, memory banks | Everything           |
| **Where it lives**     | `workspaces/<name>/` in any fork       | Separate GitHub repo |
| **Hierarchy**          | Supports `extends` for parent-child    | N/A                  |

A typical setup: each org has a fork of steer-runtime, and within that fork teams have workspaces (with hierarchy) that configure their specific setup.
